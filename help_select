The select command requires arguments. The first argument
identifies how you want to change the selection. Valid options 
are: all, clear, add, remove, and refine.
"select all" will select all records in the database.
"select clear" will deselect all records in the database.
The remaining three options modify the selection by identifying records
not currently in the selection to add ("select add"), records currently
in the section to remove ("select remove"), or records within the selection
to keep ("select refine"). These commands require an additional argument 
which is the criteria to identify the records to change. Try "select add" 
with no arguments to get help on specifying the criteria.
