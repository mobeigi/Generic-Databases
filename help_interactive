Welcome to the database program!

This is a primitive database shell that allows the user to perform 
operations like read, write, select, and delete on a database 
interactively and immediately see the results. This means you can try 
out lots of queries on your database  in a fairly easy fashion.  The 
"language" for the shell is a pretty simplistic variant-- think of it as 
mini-micro-SQL.  It has some built-in help, so you should be able to 
learn from trying things and using the helpwhen you get lost.  The command 
line reader tries to be robust in terms of ill-formed requests, but it may 
not catch everything, so be tolerant.

The first question it asks is what sort of database values you want to work
with. The program can work with database of ints, Fractions, or MyStrings 
(you can also extend the code to other types if you like).  There are sample 
data files of each type for you to read in and play with.
