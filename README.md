Generic-Databases
=========
A C++ implementation of a generic database.

The given task for this assignment was to produce a working implementation of the Record and Database objects.
The limited functionality local database allowed you to make records, delete records, select records, inverse selection etc.
The program is polymorphic and will work on all primitive types as well as all classes which have implemented the comparison operator.
Each function in the template files (*.tem) lists the complexity involved for that function. Implementation choices were made so that the overall program was faster at the expense of some functions taking longer to complete as well as a small increase in memory usage in the average case.
