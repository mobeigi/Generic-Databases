These select commands requires a criteria argument. The criteria
should be given in the form <fieldname> <op> <value>. <fieldname> can be 
any string (including spaces). This fieldname will be compared with all 
pairs in a record to find any fields of that name. You can use * to indicate 
a match to any fieldname. <op> can be any of these 5 symbols: =, !=, <, >, ^.
<value> is the value to match or compare to. The correct format for the value
depends on the type of values in the database.  For MyString values, any
string (including spaces) is accepted.
Some examples:
-- "select add name = Bill Clinton" would add any record having a name field 
with value Bill Clinton to the current selection
-- "select remove state < FL" would remove records in the current selection 
with a state field that has a value less-than (alphabetically) than FL.
-- "select refine * = 10"  would refine the selection to only include those 
records that have a value of 10 (for any field).
